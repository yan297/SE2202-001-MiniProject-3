Founded in 2016, we have one goal: efficient visualization of complex data and processes in real time. Find out more about us: https://peakboard.com/en/\n\n\nAbout the project:\n\nWe are looking for a web developer who can help us create dashboard templates for our website. The project is not necessarily an actual web project, however it requires the skillset of a web developer. You will for example have to talk to APIs and accumulate, prepare and visualize data in an understandable and attractive way in the form of a dashboard.\n\nThe dashboard templates that you create will then be displayed on our website es part of the template portal https://templates.peakboard.com.\n\n\nAbout the Job:\n\nWe develop new ideas for actual use cases of the Peakboard box every day. Your job will be to realize our ideas and turn them into actual templates, using our own software, the Peakboard designer.\n\nTherefore you will have to think about how to store the data, what the raw data could look like in the actual environment, how to work with it and prepare it and how the dashboard could look like in the end. We will of course brief you thoroughly and draw out the ideas on paper beforehand. Also, you will receive feedback regularly and we will support you with our knowledge.\n\nTo get started, you will be needing nothing but your imagination and the Peakboard Designer, our own software and design tool, which can be downloaded for free: https://peakboard.com/peakboard-designer/ The preview function in the Peakboard Designer simulates the final visualization on the Peakboard box.\n\nWe\u2019re looking for a long-term relationship, because we are constantly in need of new templates. As a first step we would like to create a first paid test template with you. You\u2019ll receive more details about it after getting in touch with us."

As of the moment, I own and manage an on-site tutorial school, but due to recent developments and circumstances surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic, I thought it would be best to be able to migrate to a better arrangement with my students and teachers, in order for us to be able to continue and teach our students safely and securely. I am not that technically knowledgeable of all things IT, so we thought of seeking help from people like you, and opt to choose the best among the ones who replied here favorably in response to our need. Right now, and as to how we are doing it on-site, we need to be able to \u201ctranslate\u201d our in-session tutoring to an online portal where we can teach students with all subjects needed for daily class activities, homework help, and other academic needs. So by that, we need a virtual classroom with a virtual whiteboard also, that would enable us to teach not only language subjects, but also Math, the Sciences, and the like. So the software or platform that we need is something that would have those initial functions, like audio-visual and text capabilities, one-on-one and group setting tutorials, screen-sharing, etc\u2026 It would be very helpful in our choosing whoever will be assigned to commission this project, if you have done something similar in the past, or have developed a program such as the one we require.
